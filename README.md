## Symbiodiniaceae Community Profiling of Three *Acropora* Coral Species from northwestern Philippines
This repository contains scripts and documentation for the analysis of Symbiodiniaceae community composition in three species of *Acropora* corals: *Acropora cf. tenuis*, *Acropora millepora*, and *Acropora digitifera*. Coral samples were collected from Caniogan and Magsaysay reefs (4–5 m depth) in the Bolinao-Anda Reef Complex, Pangasinan, northwestern Philippines (October–November 2021).

High-throughput sequencing, targeting the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, was performed on genomic DNA extracted from airbrushed coral tissue homogenates. The resulting raw sequence data were used to characterize Symbiodiniaceae community structure and investigate the association between photosymbiont diversity and coral thermotolerance across congeneric and conspecific hosts.
